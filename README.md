# POC_FullStack
It is a full stack project using MongoDb in the backend with NodeJS and React and REDUX in the front end.

# Since we have only the login option in the Application.
#New user registration is possible by performing the following steps in the postman:
1. Create a POST request with the URL http://localhost:5000/api/users
2. Add "Content-Type" = "application/json" as the headers
3. In the body add the below json and all 3 values for a new user registeration
{
	"name": "test123",
	"email": "test123@gmail.com",
	"password": "123456"
}

- Once you have created the user u can use, those credentials to run the App.

# I have created 3 login credentials using the register service in the Project:
1. username : admin1@gmail.com password: 123456
2. username : admin12@gmail.com password: 123456
3. username : test123@gmail.com password:123456
